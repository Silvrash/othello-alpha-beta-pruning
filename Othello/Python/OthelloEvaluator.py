    """
    This interface defines the mandatory methods for an evaluator, i.e., a class that can take a position and
    return an integer value that represents a heuristic evaluation of the position (positive numbers if the position is
    better for the first player, white). Notice that an evaluator is not supposed to make moves in the position to
    'see into the future', but only evaluate the static features of the postion.

    def move_priority(self, action: OthelloAction):
        """
        Calculate move priority for move ordering optimization.

        This method assigns priority values to moves to improve alpha-beta
        pruning efficiency. Higher priority moves are searched first,
        increasing the likelihood of early cutoffs.

        Priority order (highest to lowest):
        1. Corner moves (1000) - Most stable
        2. Edge moves (100) - Stable
        3. Center moves (10) - Good for early game
        4. Regular moves (1) - Neutral
        5. C-square moves (-500) - Dangerous
        6. X-square moves (-1000) - Most dangerous
        7. Pass moves (-âˆž) - Only when forced

        Args:
            action (OthelloAction): The move to evaluate
